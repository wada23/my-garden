    <h3>welcome to my garden</h2>
    <p>Hello and welcome. I am curently studying web developement and
        since I was not very succesfull with JavaScript I decided to start all over. 
        And I mean from a scratch. From zero. Like I have never learnt anything at all. 
        Hopefully I actually learned a lot and that is why I can skip the "recipe project" 
        and try to create this awsome garden webpage instead. So here we go. Welcome and enjoy!   
    </p>

    <h3>let's start with some garden themed pictures</h3>
